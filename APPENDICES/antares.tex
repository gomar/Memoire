A large effort is put today on CFD flow solvers
to deliver results as fast as possible while
maintaining their fidelity. Moreover, the trend
for years to come is to use unsteady simulations more 
often if not on a daily basis.

Nevertheless, a CFD result is meaningless
if it is not post-processed. The aim of post-processing is
to transform raw simulation results into a human-understandable
results. To do so, several approaches exist such as;
