\citet{Verdon1984} originally developed unsteady linearized 
method in the framework of potential flows. Latter on, \citet{Hall1989}
extended the linearized method to Euler equations and
\citet{Clark2000} applied it on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations
yielding the LUR method.
It method relies on a decomposition of the variables
into a steady part and a small-disturbance unsteady component:
\begin{equation}
	u = \overline{u} + u^\prime,
	\label{eq:sm_lur_decomposition}
\end{equation}
where $u^\prime$ is considered to be a small unsteady perturbation. 
In his thesis,
\citet{Hall1987} defines small to be less than $10\%$ of the
steady flow.
Injecting Eq.~\ref{eq:sm_lur_decomposition} into 
Eq.~\ref{eq:sm_nonlinear_convection_conservative} leads to:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial u^\prime}{\partial t} + 
	\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[
	\overline{u}^2 + 2 \overline{u} u^\prime + u^\prime u^\prime \right] = 
	0.
	\label{eq:sm_lur_step_1}
\end{equation}
By means of linearization, i.e. collecting terms
of equal order and neglecting terms of higher order, 
Eq.~\ref{eq:sm_lur_step_1} can be split
into a steady equation:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial \overline{u}^2}{\partial x} = 0,
	\label{eq:sm_lur_step_2}
\end{equation}
and an unsteady first order perturbation equation:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial u^\prime}{\partial t} +
	\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[
	\overline{u} u^\prime \right] = 
	0.
	\label{eq:sm_lur_step_3}
\end{equation}
One can see that Eq.~\ref{eq:sm_lur_step_2} does not depends
on the value of the perturbations $u^\prime$, but the 
inverse does.
This means that we have a one-way coupling: the steady field
is first computed and then given as an input to the
perturbation equation to compute
the corresponding unsteady disturbances.

\paragraph{Mono-frequential formulation}
As said before, spectral methods have been developed to efficiently
capture periodic phenomena.
Hence, assuming that the velocity perturbation is harmonic at 
a pulsation $\omega$, one can write:
\begin{equation}
	u^\prime = \widehat{u}_k e^{i \omega t}.
\end{equation}
Injecting this definition into Eq.~\ref{eq:sm_lur_step_3} leads
to:
\begin{equation}
	i \omega \widehat{u}_k +
	\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[
	\overline{u} \widehat{u}_k \right] = 
	0.
	\label{eq:sm_lur_step_4}
\end{equation}
Finally a pseudo-time $\tau$ is added to time-march 
Eq.~\ref{eq:sm_lur_step_2} and Eq.~\ref{eq:sm_lur_step_4}
to the steady state:
\begin{equation}
	\fbox{$
	\begin{cases}
		\displaystyle 
		\frac{\partial \overline{u}}{\partial \tau} +
		\frac{\partial 
			\overline{u}^2}{\partial x} &= 0 \\
		\displaystyle \frac{\partial \widehat{u}_k}{\partial \tau} +
		i \omega \widehat{u}_k +
			\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left[
			\overline{u} \widehat{u}_k \right] &= 
			0.
	\end{cases}
	$}
\end{equation}
Note that the last equation is complex meaning that actually two
equations are solved.

\paragraph{Extension to the Navier-Stokes equations}
To extend the LUR method to the Reynolds-Averaged
Navier-Stokes, one has to linearized theses lasts. This
is not particularly difficult as only the first order terms should
be kept. The reader is referred to the paper of \citet{Clark2000} for
a detailed development of the LUR method to the Navier-Stokes
equations.

\paragraph{Cost of the method}
As the method is made of three equations in total, one steady equation 
(namely a classical RANS equation) and two perturbation equations
since the equation is complex, if $\mathdollar_{\text{RANS}}$ 
denotes the CPU cost of
one steady computation, then
\begin{equation}
	\mathdollar_{\text{LUR}} = 3 \cdot \mathdollar_{\text{RANS}}
\end{equation}
