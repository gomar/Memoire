\chapter{Spectral methods}
\label{cha:spectral_methods}

\chabstract{The spectral methods are presented in this chapter.
Actually four are presented: the Linearized 
Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (LUR), 
the NonLinear Harmonic (NLH), 
the NonLinear Frequency Domain (NLFD) 
and the Harmonic Balance (HB) method. The LUR
method comes from a linearization of the governing equation
while the three others are build to take into account for the 
non-linearities. The NLH, NLFD and HB methods
rely on the decomposition of the variable of interest
in Fourier series. By truncating these at order $N$,
$2N+1$ steady equations coupled by
a source term are developed. 
Emphasis is put on the development
of multi-frequential formulation and its
mathematical background to allow multi-stage
configurations.
The applicability of 
these methods is demonstrated in the literature
through analytical test cases, $2$D/$3$D academic 
turbomachine configurations,
industrial transonic multi-stage applications, 
aeroelastic configurations and even unsteady
optimization problems. The cost of the method
is almost $2N+1$ times the cost of a steady
computation with $N$ being the number of computed harmonics.}

\chconclu{Four spectral methods have been presented in this chapter.
The main mathematical development have been demonstrated and 
the weakness/hypothesis of each method has been highlighted.
The large literature available on these methods shows that
they are ready for industrial, numerically hard
unsteady applications.}
