\paragraph{Mono-frequential formulation}

Originally proposed by \citet{McMullen2001}, the NonLinear Frequency Domain
method relies on a simple observation: to develop spectral methods, and in
particular the NonLinear Harmonic method, one has made use of the Fourier
series to efficiently represent an unsteady signal.
This representation is then used to compute the unsteady
equations by converting them into $2N+1$ steady equations coupled by a 
source term where $N$ is small.
However, the method needs to be resolved in the frequency domain meaning
that all the numerical techniques should be adapted: the numerical schemes,
the turbulent models and so on. The smart idea 
proposed by \citet{McMullen2001} is to
make use of the Fast Fourier Transform and its inverse to
make it easy to implement in a classical time-domain code.

To explain the development of this method, let us first 
write Eq.~\ref{eq:sm_nonlinear_convection_conservative} 
in a more general form:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + R = 0,
	\label{eq:sm_nonlinear_convection_residual}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
	R = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( 
	\frac{u^2}{2} \right).
\end{equation}
Let us now consider that both $u$ and $R$ are periodic
in time with respect to period $T = 2 \pi / \omega$
and can be written using a Fourier series:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		u(t) &= \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \widehat{u}_k e^{i k \omega t}, \\
		R(t) &= \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} \widehat{R}_k e^{i k \omega t}.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
Injecting these decompositions into 
Eq.~\ref{eq:sm_nonlinear_convection_residual} and taking into account
for the orthogonality of the complex exponentials leads to:
\begin{equation}
	i k \omega \widehat{u}_k + \widehat{R}_k = 0, \: k \in [-\infty, \infty].
\end{equation}
As previously, only a small number of harmonic $N$ is kept and 
a pseudo-time ($\tau$) derivative is added to march the equations
in pseudo-time to the steady-state solutions of all the harmonics:
\begin{equation}
	\fbox{$
	\displaystyle \frac{\partial \widehat{u}_k}{\partial \tau} + 
	i k \omega \widehat{u}_k + \widehat{R}_k = 0, \: k \in [-N, N].
	$}
	\label{eq:sm_nlfd_subset_eq}
\end{equation}
The fact that $R(t)$ is expressed using its own Fourier series 
makes it simpler to implement 
as it avoid developing its expression using 
the complex coefficients $\widehat{u}_k$.
However, $\widehat{R}_k$ must be evaluated. To do so, as depicted
in Fig.~\ref{fig:nlfd_principle}, \citet{McMullen2001}
propose to use an Inverse Fast-Fourier Transform (IFFT) to get
$u(t)$ from $\widehat{u}_k$. Then the considered governing equation
is used to evaluate $R(t)$ which leads to $\widehat{R}_k$
through a Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT). Finally, the next iteration value 
$\widehat{u}_k$
is evaluated by adding $\widehat{R}_k$ and 
the corresponding temporal derivative $i k \omega \widehat{u}_k$. All
harmonics are coupled through the IFFT and FFT operations
that needs all of them to compute the counterpart temporal signal.

\paragraph{Extension to the Navier-Stokes equations}
The Navier-Stokes equations can be written in finite-volume,
semi-discrete form as:
\begin{equation}
	V \frac{\partial W}{\partial t} + R(W) = 0.
	\label{eq:navier_stokes_fv_sd}
\end{equation}
This formulation is exactly the same as the one of 
Eq.~\ref{eq:sm_nonlinear_convection_residual} meaning that
nothing particular has to be made to derive this approach for
the Navier-Stokes equations. This is indeed very attractive as the
method can be applied almost directly, except for the FFT and IFFT
part that should be added into the time loop.

\paragraph{Time line}

  \label{fig:timeline_nlfd}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:timeline_nlfd} shows the time line of the
development of the NonLinear Frequency Domain method.
The method was first introduced by \citet{McMullen2001}
at Stanford University and applied to the two-dimensional
Navier-Stokes equations. It has been validated against an
unsteady channel flow that admits an analytical 
solution~\cite{Merkle1987} and applied to a cylinder
vortex shedding. This could be done as the frequency of the
vortex shedding was known \textit{a priori} from experimental
and numerical data. However, for a given cylinder, it is not
possible to know this frequency. This is why \citet{McMullen2002}
proposed a gradient based method for determining the period.
They applied their algorithm to find the frequency of the vortex
shedding around a cylinder. \todo{a am√©liorer}
