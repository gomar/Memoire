There is a large variety of spectral methods that exists in the
literature. The most important will be presented in this section.
As the development of these approaches on the Navier-Stokes equations
can be tedious, the following developments 
will only concentrate on the simplest
nonlinear partial differential equation, 
the non-viscous Burger's equation defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + 
	u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 
	0.
	\label{eq:sm_nonlinear_convection}
\end{equation}
This equation can be formulated in a conservative manner for simplicity:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + 
	\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{u^2}{2} \right) = 
	0.
	\label{eq:sm_nonlinear_convection_conservative}
\end{equation}

In total four spectral methods are presented, 
the \underline{L}inearized \underline{U}nsteady 
\underline{R}eynolds averaged
Navier-Stokes method (LUR), 
the \underline{N}on\underline{L}inear 
\underline{H}armonic method (NLH), the \underline{N}onLinear 
\underline{F}requency \underline{D}omain
method (NLFD) and the \underline{H}armonic \underline{B}alance 
method (HB).
These names are chosen here
for clarity but the reader might find in the literature many more
appellations. When this is the case, an effort will be made to synthesize
these appellations to give the reader a good 
overview of the type of spectral methods that exist in the literature
and their differences. 
Moreover, special emphasis will be put on the harmonic
balance method as it is the approach used in this thesis.
Since the development of the methods will be presented 
on the non-viscous
Burger's equation, the reader is referred to 
the cited papers for a detailed description of 
specific development of spectral methods
on the Navier-Stokes equations.
