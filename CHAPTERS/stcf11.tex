\section{Validation of the proposed approach} % (fold)
\label{sec:validation_of_the_proposed_approach}


For external-flow aeroelasticity, the HB approach has 
been thoroughly validated~\cite{Gopinath2005,Sicot2008,Woodgate2009,Dufour2010}, 
mostly for the AGARD test cases of Davis~\cite{Davis1982}. 
However, experimental data for turbomachinery aeroelasticity are more scarce: 
the Standard Aeroelastic Configurations experiments 
of Fransson~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Fransson:1999uq} are the 
reference in this respect, and have been widely used 
to validate different numerical approaches~\cite{Sbardella:2001fk,
Duta:2002uq,Campobasso:2003fk,Cinnella2004,mcbean2005}. 


The $11$\textsuperscript{th} standard configuration is a
turbine stator composed of 20~blades, and tested at EPF-Lausanne
in the late 1990's by Fransson~\emph{et al.}~\cite{Fransson:1999uq}.
The test cascade is placed in a 
annular test rig as depicted in~Fig.\ref{fig:annular_channel}
\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \caption{Annular test rig for the standard configurations}
  \label{fig:annular_channel}
\end{figure}
The experimental results have been found to be highly reproducible and
therefore suitable for code validation~\cite{Fransson:1999uq}.  


% geometry presentation
The geometry profile and the results are available over the
internet~\cite{stcf11web}.  To allow local validation of the steady
flow, the isentropic Mach number is given at blade wall.

The blades oscillate harmonically in the first bending mode
at a reduced frequency of $f_{c} =\pi \cdot c \cdot
f/U_{outlet, exp} = 0.2134$ for the subsonic case and $0.1549$ for the
transonic case. Aeroelastic
results are available such as the first harmonic of the unsteady pressure
coefficient at blade walls (amplitude and phase), for several nodal
diameters. The integrated
results, such as the damping, strongly vary under small changes in the
local distribution. It is therefore recommended to look at the local
distributions.
 
% mesh presentation
The blade passage is meshed using an O4H topology (Fig.~\ref{fig:stcf11_mesh}).  
The number of grid points along the blade
chord axis is~160 and the computed $y^+$ at the walls is $\mathcal{O}(1)$. % proving
The blade has the same profile along the spanwise direction and no
twist. Therefore, a 2.5D mesh is used with five points in the radial direction, with a spanwise
extent representing $1\%$ of the chord. 

% boundary conditions
The boundary conditions used for this case are: (i)~an
injection condition  for the inlet (with a relative flow angle
set to the  experimental value), (ii)~a constant static pressure
condition for the outlet,  (iii)~an adiabatic no-slip condition on
blade walls, and (iv)~periodic or phase-lagged conditions for azimuthal boundaries depending on the  
prescribed IBPA.

% numerical parameters
Turbulence is modeled using the one-equation model of
Spalart-Allmaras~\cite{Spalart1992}.  The third-order upwind Roe
scheme~\cite{Roe1981} is used to compute the convective fluxes.
The maximum
CFL number is set to~20 for the steady computations,  the inner loop
of the DTS scheme and the HB simulations.  For the DTS scheme,  
convergence in time discretization is obtained
after 20~periods using 128~instants per period.  Iterative convergence 
for the inner loop is considered achieved when the normalized
residuals drop by $5\cdot 10^{-2}$ (within a maximum of
50~sub-iterations).

\subsection{Subsonic Case}
The measured inlet Mach number is $0.31$ and the isentropic outlet Mach number is $0.69$.
% steady results
Steady results for the isentropic Mach number at blade walls are compared to the experimental data in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:stcf11_rans_subsonic}.  For this flow regime, the flow
remains subsonic.
On the pressure side, the flow accelerates all the way
to the trailing edge of the blade. On the suction side, the flow
accelerates until a maximum speed at $\approx 40~\%$ of the chord and
then decelerates (Fig.~\ref{fig:stcf11_subsonic_field_mis_bw}).
The agreement with the experimental data is fair. However, an
over-prediction of the isentropic Mach number is observed on the suction
side.  This discrepancy is also reported in the literature (see
Ref.~\cite{Fransson:1999uq} for instance).

% unsteady results
The aeroelastic experimental data are compared to the present results
obtained with both the DTS and the HB approach. To explore the range
of nodal diameters with the HB method, an incremental approach is used
where each nodal diameter simulation is used to initialize the next
one.  Considering the opposite phase vibration case (the 10\textsuperscript{th} nodal diameter), 
the amplitude and the phase of the pressure coefficient are
presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:stcf11_ael_subsonic_ibpa_180_paper}.
With only one harmonic (\emph{i.e.},~three instants), the HB results
are superimposed on the DTS ones. Moreover, the numerical results are
in fair agreement with the experimental data for the
amplitude. However, for the phase, the sign change on the
suction side is predicted at about $60~\%$ of the chord, whereas the
experimental location is about 25~\%.

\end{figure}


The results for the  nodal  diameter $-2$ are shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:stcf11_ael_subsonic_ibpa_324_paper}. The HB and DTS data
are superimposed, and are in fair agreement with the experiments. The
amplitude levels are well captured and the phase prediction is
slightly improved over the opposite phase case.

The damping obtained from the previous calculations is depicted 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:stcf11_subsonic_damping}.  Also plotted are the results
from Fransson~\emph{et al.}~\cite{Fransson:1999uq}, obtained with both
potential, linear Euler, non-linear Euler and non-linear viscous codes.
The results for all IBPAs are given for the potential code but only $\beta=180^\circ$ is provided for the other codes~\cite{Fransson:1999uq}.
These are the only damping results for the
subsonic case known by the authors.  Since the local variations are
superimposed for the DTS and the HB approaches, so are the damping.
The present
results show similar trends and levels to those of Fransson~\emph{et al.}

\end{figure}



\subsection{Transonic Condition}
The outlet isentropic Mach number is $0.99$ for an inlet Mach number of $0.4$. 
This case, for which experimental uncertainties are available, 
has been largely addressed in the literature 
(see for instance Refs.~\cite{Sbardella:2001fk,Duta:2002uq,Campobasso:2003fk,Cinnella2004}). 
This test case is challenging in terms of nonlinearities as a separation bubble and a shock are present.

Steady results of the isentropic Mach number are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:stcf11_rans_transonic}.  For this flow regime,
a small separation
bubble develops on the suction side at the leading edge~(cf.~Fig.~\ref{fig:stcf11_transonic_field_mis_bw}).  The flow then accelerates, followed by a passage shock.  
The experimental data suggests that the shock appears
sooner on the suction side than in the computations; all the results 
reported in the literature exhibit similar discrepancies (see
Refs.~\cite{Fransson:1999uq,Sbardella:2001fk,Duta:2002uq,Campobasso:2003fk,Cinnella2004}). 
Otherwise, the present results are in fair agreement with experimental data.

% unsteady results
The aeroelastic experimental data are compared to the present results
obtained with both the DTS and the HB approach.  Considering the opposite phase vibration case (the 10\textsuperscript{th} nodal diameter), 
the amplitude and the
phase of the pressure coefficient are presented in
Fig.~\ref{fig:stcf11_ael_transonic_ibpa_180_paper}. Also plotted are the results of
Cinnella~\emph{et~al.}~\cite{Cinnella2004}, computed with a nonlinear viscous
approach using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. The present HB and the DTS
results are superimposed, which indicates that the one harmonic HB solution is able
to reproduce the unsteady nonlinear effects without increasing the
number of harmonics. This observation is only valid near the wall,
before the harmonics are created naturally by the flow, due to the
nonlinear effects. The results are in good agreement with
the experimental data and display the same trends as that of
Cinnella~\emph{et~al.}  A slight discrepancy can be observed within the shock
region, where the amplitude and the phase phenomena are predicted
further than the experiments indicate.  This can be attributed to the poor
prediction of the shock position and hence the poor prediction
of its interaction with the motion of the blade.

  \label{fig:stcf11_ael_transonic_ibpa_180_paper}
\end{figure}

The results for the $-2$\textsuperscript{th} nodal diameter are also shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:stcf11_ael_transonic_ibpa_324_paper}. Again,
the HB results are superimposed on the DTS ones. Moreover, these are in
good agreement with the experiments, considering the uncertainties of
the experimental data.

\end{figure}

The damping is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:stcf11_transonic_damping} for
the transonic case. Also plotted are the results from
Fransson~\emph{et al.} (potential code), and 
from Cinnella~\emph{et al.} (RANS). The scattering is much more severe
than for the subsonic case. The trends obtained with the RANS approaches are similar. However, the
discrepancies between the two RANS codes are significant in terms of
levels.
Recently, Vogt and Fransson~\cite{Vogt:2011fk} reported similar discrepancies 
for damping predictions of subsonic and transonic cascades, 
showing that the damping can be significantly affected by 
small local changes in the amplitude and/or the phase.

\end{figure}
In terms of computational efficiency, the HB method is 7 times faster
than the DTS  for all the IBPAs.
