\chapter{Advantages of Fourier-based time methods}
\label{cha:advantages}

\chabstract{In this chapter, the advantage of using the 
harmonic balance operator to estimate the 
temporal derivative is assessed. First, an analytical
function, whose derivative is known, is chosen to
compare the accuracy of the estimation of the derivative.
The harmonic balance operator is compared to
two finite-difference schemes. It is shown that 
the HB operator is spectral accurate. The same
function is then used along with the linear advection toy problem
to ensure that this property is kept when iteratively solving
an equation. Finally, a function composed of two separated frequencies
is tested and it is shown that the multi-frequential
is more adapted to this configuration.}
