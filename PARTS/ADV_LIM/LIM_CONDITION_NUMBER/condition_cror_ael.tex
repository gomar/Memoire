As shown previously in Sec.~\ref{sec:cror_unsteady}, the main unsteady
phenomena encountered in CROR can be correlated with the blade passing
frequency.
In addition to that, the aeroelastic phenomenon
studied here, namely blade flutter sensibility, has a vibration frequency that
is imposed (weak coupling approach) that depends on the proper modes
of the structure (see Sec.~\ref{sub:flutter}).
In general, these are not harmonically related nor
of the same order of magnitude. Hence the use of the
multi-frequential formulation of the HB approach. 

The condition number $\kappa$ of a matrix $A$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \kappa (A) = \kappa (A^{-1}) = \| A \| \cdot \| A^{-1} \|, \quad
    \kappa(A) \geq 1,
\end{equation}
where $\| \cdot \|$ denotes a matrix norm. Considering the resolution
of the system of equation
$A x = b$, if $A$ is invertible and if $\delta A$, $\delta x$ and
$\delta b$ are the numerical errors associated with the computation of
$A$, $x$ and $b$, respectively, then:
\begin{equation}
   (A + \delta A)(x + \delta x) = b + \delta b.
   \label{eq:error_reso}
\end{equation}
By definition, the condition number sets an upper bound for 
the error made on~$x$:
\begin{equation}
   \frac{\| \delta x \|}{\| x \|} \leq 
   \kappa(A)\left[\frac{\| \delta A \|}{\| A \|} + 
   \frac{\| \delta b \|}{\| b \|} \right].
   \label{eq:conditonnig_amp}
\end{equation}
By transposing this to our problem, namely $A$ is the residual, 
$b$ the source terms and $x$ the conservative variables, one can say that
the error on the iterative resolution of the governing equations can
therefore be amplified by the harmonic balance source term.
Using the definition given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:conditonnig_amp}, this amplification is
led by the condition number of the DFT matrix $E$. 


In the mono-frequential formulation, the logical sampling is the uniform one
which has the good property of providing
a well conditioned DFT matrix $E$. In fact, in this framework, $E$ is orthogonal giving 
the smallest condition number $\kappa (E) = 1$.
In the multi-frequential framework,
the condition number of the DFT matrix $E$ is not always unity and
varies under frequencies and time instances change~\cite{Kundert1988}. 
The frequencies
being imposed by the problem that is simulated,
the only degrees of freedom left to control the condition
number are the time instances. 
Moreover, the amplitude of the unsteadinesses, represented by $\delta x$,
can not be \emph{a priori} controlled as it is ruled by the flow physics. 

All variations of the HB approach proposed in the literature rely on 
a uniform time sampling of the longest period of interest 
(though the number of samples can differ). 
This uniform time sampling can raise stability issues.
To emphasis this, let us consider two independent frequencies $f_1$
and $f_2$ that plays the role of the blade passing frequency and
the vibration frequency, respectively. The two frequencies are arbitrarily chosen between~1
and $10,000$~Hz and the corresponding
condition number of the DFT matrix $E$ is computed. 
100~points are used to discretize each 
frequency interval giving a frequency step of 100~Hz.
The results using a uniform time
sampling is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:algo_equi_assessment}.
The problem being symmetric in $(f_1, f_2)$, so are the results.
Moreover, the structure of the results seems to indicate that only the
ratio of $f_2$ over $f_1$ is important as the shape of the
solution is constant under a translation of vector $(1,f_1 / f_2)$.

Almost half of the set of frequencies have a DFT matrix $E$
whose condition number is superior to ten.
The minimum values are obtained with harmonically related couple
of frequencies. In fact, the white zones in Fig.~\ref{fig:algo_equi_assessment}
are the regions where $f_2 = n f_1$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ or $1/n \in \mathbb{N}$.
Elsewhere, the condition number is large and grows exponentially.

\end{figure}
To highlight this, the minimum, maximum, mean and 
standard deviation (noted $\sigma$) values of the
previous example are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:hb_algo_equi}.
\begin{table}[htp]
  \ra{1.3} 
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{cccc}
    \toprule
    min & max & mean & $\sigma$ \\
    \midrule
    $1.0$ & $9.4\e{16}$ & $1.5\e{14}$ & $2.8\e{15}$ \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Condition number of the discrete Fourier transform matrix $E$: 
  statistics for two independent frequencies using evenly spaced time instances.}
  \label{tab:hb_algo_equi}
\end{table}  
The values of the maximum, mean and standard deviation are tremendous
and the standard deviation is greater than the mean
($\sigma > $ mean) preventing the blindly use of such a sampling strategy for 
multi-frequential HB computations.
In numerical methods, it is common to deal with ill-conditioned
problems. However, we will show below that HB results are 
very sensitive to the condition number of the DFT matrix $E$.
To do so, the linear advection problem
presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:presentation_advection}
and the channel flow problem presented in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:channel_flow_problem}
are used with varying condition number and input unsteadinesses.
