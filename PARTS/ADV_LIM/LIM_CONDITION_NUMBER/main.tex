\chapter{Discrete Fourier transform matrix condition number}
\label{cha:limitations_condition_number}

\chabstract{The harmonic balance approach used in the
present work can be ill-conditioned when using the
multi-frequential framework.
In this chapter, it
is first recalled that the aeroelasticity of contra-rotating
open rotor is driven by two unsteadinesses, each of which having its own
frequency. The multi-frequential framework is thus chosen. Secondly, the
sensibility of the harmonic balance results against the condition
number of the discrete Fourier transform matrix $E$ 
is shown by using the linear advection toy problem.
Finally, to overcome this sensibility, non-uniform
time instances, as proposed by \citet{JGuedeney2013},
are used together with algorithms to automatically
choose them by minimizing the corresponding condition number.
In particular, the optimization algorithm developed
in the present work gives very good results for any input frequencies,
enabling the use of the multi-frequential harmonic balance
for the simulation of contra-rotating open rotor aeroelasticity.}

\chconclu{We have seen that the condition number of the
discrete Fourier transform matrix $E$ can be large
when using the multi-frequential framework. For the present work,
the problem of contra-rotating open rotor aeroelasticity is
by essence multi-frequential. It has been shown that in this context,
the condition number has to be minimize for the harmonic balance
results to be reliable. To ensure that, non-uniform time instances
in combination with a gradient based optimization algorithm are used
and enables the use of the multi-frequential harmonic balance
for the simulation of contra-rotating open rotor aeroelasticity.}
