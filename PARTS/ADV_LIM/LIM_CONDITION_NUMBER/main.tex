\chabstract{
Problems characterized by multiple frequencies require 
multi-frequential harmonic balance discretization operators.
These can be ill-conditioned for some combinations 
of the discrete frequencies.
In this chapter, we investigate the sensitivity of 
harmonic balance solutions to the condition number of the 
discrete Fourier transform matrix for a linear advection problem
and a non-linear channel flow problem.
Highlighted is the fact that when the condition number is greater
than one, the unsteadiness can be badly reproduced preventing the use
of such an approach.
To improve the condition number, we consider a non-uniform
distribution of the times instances (\citet{ThesisGuedeney}),
along with an optimization algorithm minimizing the
condition number of the discrete Fourier transform matrix.
The optimization algorithm developed
in the present work gives very good results for any input frequencies,
enabling the use of the multi-frequential harmonic balance
for the simulation of contra-rotating open rotor aeroelasticity.

% \section*{Summary}

% We have seen that the condition number of the
% discrete Fourier transform matrix $E$ can be large
% when using the multi-frequential framework. The present work,
% namely contra-rotating open rotor aeroelasticity, is
% by essence multi-frequential. It has been shown that in this context,
% the condition number has to be minimize for the harmonic balance
% computations to converge and the results to be reliable. 
% To ensure that, non-uniform time instances
% are used together with the OPT algorithm that provides an
% optimal condition number for any input frequencies.
