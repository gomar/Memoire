\chapter{Source term condition number}
\label{cha:limitations_condition_number}

\chabstract{The harmonic balance approach used in the
present work can be ill-conditioned when using the
multi-frequential framework.
In this chapter, it
is first recalled that the aeroelasticity of contra-rotating
open rotor is driven by two unsteadinesses, each of which having its own
frequency. The multi-frequential framework is thus chosen and, secondly, the
sensibility of the harmonic balance results against the condition
number of the discrete Fourier transform matrix $E$ 
is shown through the use of linear advection toy problem.
Finally, non-uniform time instances that are automatically
chosen using different algorithms are shown to minimize the
condition number. In particular, the optimization algorithm developed
during the present work gives very good results for any input frequencies,
enabling the use of the multi-frequential harmonic balance
for the simulation of contra-rotating open rotor aeroelasticity.}
