\chapter{Discrete Fourier transform matrix condition number}
\label{cha:limitations_condition_number}

\chabstract{In this chapter, it
is first recalled that the aeroelasticity of contra-rotating
open rotor is driven by two unsteady phenomena, each of which having its own
frequency. The multi-frequential framework of the harmonic balance approach
is thus needed. 
The problem is that this method can be ill-conditioned when using the
multi-frequential framework.
To this aim, the sensibility of the harmonic balance results against the condition
number of the discrete Fourier transform matrix $E$ 
is shown by using the linear advection toy problem.
Highlighted is the fact that when the condition number is greater
than one, the unsteadiness can be badly reproduced preventing the use
of such an approach.
To overcome this sensibility, non-uniform
time instances, as proposed by \citet{ThesisGuedeney},
are used together with algorithms to automatically
choose them to minimize the corresponding condition number.
In particular, the optimization algorithm developed
in the present work gives very good results for any input frequencies,
enabling the use of the multi-frequential harmonic balance
for the simulation of contra-rotating open rotor aeroelasticity.}

\chconclu{We have seen that the condition number of the
discrete Fourier transform matrix $E$ can be large
when using the multi-frequential framework. The present work,
namely contra-rotating open rotor aeroelasticity, is
by essence multi-frequential. It has been shown that in this context,
the condition number has to be minimize for the harmonic balance
computations to converge and the results to be reliable. 
To ensure that, non-uniform time instances
are used together with the OPT algorithm that provides an
optimal condition number for any input frequencies.}
