\chapter{Limitations and solutions: Source term condition number}
\label{cha:limitations_condition_number}

\chabstract{As shown in the the introductory 
chapter~\ref{cha:spectral_methods}, the condition number of the
discrete Fourier transform matrix $E$ is not necessarily 
one in the multi-frequential framework. In this chapter, it
is first recalled that the aeroelasticity of contra-rotating
open rotor is driven by two unsteadinesses, each of which having its own
frequency. The multi-frequential framework is thus chosen and the
sensibility of the harmonic balance results against the condition
number of $E$ is shown secondly through the use of the two toys problems.
Finally, the use of non-uniform time instances that are automatically
chosen using different algorithm is shown to ensure a small condition
number. In particular, the optimization algorithm developed
during the present work gives vary good results for any input frequencies,
enabling the use of the multi-frequential harmonic balance
for the simulation of contra-rotating open rotor aeroelasticity.}
