\chabstract{Efficiency of Fourier-based time methods results 
from a trade-off between accuracy and 
costs requirements.
On one hand, the accuracy depends on the number of harmonics
used to represent the frequency content of the time 
signal; on the other hand, computational costs and 
memory consumption of the computations also scale
with the number of harmonics. 
The problem is that this number is 
configuration-dependent. 
Studies on the convergence of 
Fourier-based time methods for turbomachinery simulations 
have been previously reported in the literature, but with scattered results. 
For instance, using a frequency-domain approach, 
\citet{Vilmin2006} obtain accurate solutions 
using 5~harmonics for a compressor stage and 3~harmonics for a 
centripetal turbine stage. For a transonic compressor stage with 
forced blade vibration, \citet{ekici2010} use 
up to 7~harmonics with a time-domain harmonic balance approach. Finally, for a 
subsonic compressor stage, \citet{JSicot2012} report 
that 4~harmonics is the minimal requirement to properly capture wake interactions.
Moreover, a high number of harmonics
($\gg 10$) can prevent the use of such an approach,
as it might be more expensive than a classical time-marching approach.
This is particularly true on CROR configurations where the number
of harmonics needed to reach convergence
has been shown to be greater than ten
on some configurations, as shown by \citet{ThesisFrancois}.
In this chapter, the accuracy and convergence properties 
of Fourier-based time methods are investigated. 
It is highlighted that the convergence rate 
of these methods, in terms of harmonics required to describe the solution 
with a given level of accuracy, depends on the spectral content of the 
solution itself: Fourier-based time methods are particularly efficient 
for flow problems characterized by a narrow Fourier 
spectrum. Based on the similarity law of \citet{Lakshminarayana1980},
the specific case of turbomachinery wake passing is considered
and an analytical truncation error is defined. Then,
a model turbomachinery problem is set up, which shows
that the analytical truncation error can be \emph{a priori} 
estimated using a mixing-plane steady computation.

\chconclu{In this chapter, 
we showed that the main impulsive source of unsteadiness in 
turbomachinery flows is due to the relative motion of wakes 
generated by a given blade row with respect to the downstream row.
\citet{Lakshminarayana1980} showed that the wake shed
behind turbomachinery blades follows a similarity law for the velocity. 
It can be empirically approximated by a Gaussian function.
The Fourier transform of a Gaussian function being analytical,
a truncation error has been defined, which showed that the narrower the wake, 
the larger the Fourier spectrum resulting in a slower convergence 
of Fourier-based time methods.
Based on these observations,
we showed on a model turbomachinery computation, that
the analytical truncation error can be \emph{a priori} 
estimated using a mixing-plane steady computation.
Applying the \emph{a priori} error estimate to 
the steady computation of any turbomachinery configuration
provides a lower bound of the number of harmonics required 
to achieve a given level of convergence.}
