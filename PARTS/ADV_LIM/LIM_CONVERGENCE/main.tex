\chapter{Convergence of Fourier-based 
time methods for turbomachinery wake passing problems}
\label{cha:limitations_convergence}

\chabstract{Theoretical results about the convergence of spectral methods 
(see e.g. \citet{Canuto2006}
for a comprehensive review) predict convergence of the numerical 
solution starting from a given number of harmonics, provided 
that the approximated function satisfies some regularity 
requirements~\cite{Zygmund1959}. 
Nevertheless, this number of harmonics is configuration-dependent 
and hardly predictable. Studies on the convergence of 
Fourier-based time methods for turbomachinery simulations 
have been previously reported in the literature, but with scattered results. 
For instance, using a frequency-domain approach, 
\citet{Vilmin2006} obtain accurate solutions 
using 5~harmonics for a compressor stage and 3~harmonics for a 
centripetal turbine stage. For a transonic compressor stage with 
forced blade vibration, \citet{ekici2010} use 
up to 7~harmonics with a time-domain harmonic balance approach. Finally, for a 
subsonic compressor stage, \citet{JSicot2012} report 
that 4~harmonics is the minimal requirement to properly capture wake interactions.. 
The goal of the present chapter is twofold: to analyze the
convergence of Fourier-based time method, 
with focus on turbomachinery applications, 
and to provide a criterion for the minimal number of harmonics 
required to achieve a specified accuracy level.}

% \chconclu{We have seen that the convergence rate 
% of Fourier-based time methods and hence the harmonic balance approach, 
% in terms of harmonics required to describe the solution 
% with a given level of accuracy, depends on the spectral content of the 
% solution itself: Fourier-based time methods are particularly efficient 
% for flow problems characterized by a narrow Fourier 
% spectrum. We show that main source of unsteadiness in 
% turbomachinery flows is due to the relative motion of wakes 
% generated by a given blade row with respect to the downstream row. 
% Statistically speaking, the passing wakes are seen by the downstream 
% row as an azimuthally advected periodic Gaussian pulse, 
% characterized by its relative thickness compared to the pitch 
% in between two subsequent blades and by the velocity deficit 
% associated to it. We show that the narrower the wake, the larger 
% its Fourier spectrum, and the slower the convergence of Fourier-based time methods.
% In order to achieve \emph{a priori} estimates of the number of 
% harmonics required to accurately solve a given turbomachinery 
% problem, we introduce two error measures based on the relative 
% thickness of the passing wakes. It is shown that, for practical 
% purposes, these can be preliminarily estimated by running a 
% companion steady simulation of the turbomachinery stage. The 
% steady simulation is post-processed to extract information about 
% the spanwise distribution of wake thickness, and an error criterion 
% is used to estimate the number of harmonics required to resolve 99\% 
% of the energy content associated to the velocity signal. The 
% preliminary step has a negligible cost compared to the overall 
% simulation, since the steady computation is used to initialize 
% the unsteady run, and extraction of wake characteristics takes 
% less than a minute on a single processor. 
% The proposed methodology represents an efficient and reliable 
% operational tool to guide the choice of the number of harmonics 
% for a given turbomachinery problem, and to evaluate beforehand the 
% interest of applying or not a Fourier-based time integration scheme 
% instead of a classical time-marching scheme.}
