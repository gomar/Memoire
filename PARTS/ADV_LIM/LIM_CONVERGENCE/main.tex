\chapter{Convergence of Fourier-based 
time methods for turbomachinery wake passing problems}
\label{cha:limitations_convergence}

\chabstract{Efficiency of the HB method results from a trade-off between accuracy and 
costs requirements.
On one hand, the accuracy of Fourier-based time methods depends on the number of harmonics
used to represent the frequency content of the time signal; on the other
hand, computational costs and memory consumption of the computations also scale
with the number of harmonics. Theoretical results about the convergence of spectral methods 
(see e.g. Canuto~\emph{et al.}~\cite{Canuto2006}
for a comprehensive review) predict convergence of the numerical 
solution starting from a given number of harmonics, provided 
that the approximated function satisfies some regularity 
requirements~\cite{Zygmund1959}. 
Nevertheless, this number of harmonics is configuration-dependent 
and hardly predictable. In this work, we focus on turbomachinery 
configurations, which involve flow across a series of fixed and 
rotating bladed wheels. Studies on the convergence of 
Fourier-based time methods for turbomachinery simulations 
have been previously reported in the literature, but with scattered results. 
For instance, using a frequency-domain approach, 
Vilmin~\emph{et al.}~\cite{Vilmin2006} obtain accurate solutions 
using 5~harmonics for a compressor stage and 3~harmonics for a 
centripetal turbine stage. For a transonic compressor stage with 
forced blade vibration, Ekici~\emph{et al.}~\cite{ekici2010} use 
up to 7~harmonics with a time-domain harmonic balance approach. Finally, for a 
subsonic compressor stage, Sicot~\emph{et al.}~\cite{JSicot2012} report 
that 4~harmonics is the minimal requirement to properly capture wake interactions
as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:cme2}.

The preceding examples show that no consensus exists in the literature 
concerning the number of harmonics needed to achieve convergence,
even for similar configurations.
The goal of the present paper is twofold: to analyze the
convergence of Fourier-based time method, with focus on turbomachinery applications, 
and to provide a criterion for the minimal number of harmonics 
required to achieve a specified accuracy level. The paper is organized as follows: first,
we recall the design principles of the time-domain harmonic balance 
approach and theoretical results about the convergence of Fourier-based methods.
Second, the HB method is applied to the linear advection equation 
supplemented with unsteady boundary conditions of different degrees of smoothness,
to highlight the impact of solution regularity on HB convergence. 
Third, a model problem representative of a turbomachinery wake-passing 
configuration is set up, and different
error measures are introduced to compare the numerical and analytical solutions. 
These error measures allows finally to define a prediction tool, 
which is applied to contra-rotating open rotor simulations.

\chconclu{The accuracy and efficiency of Fourier-based time methods 
used to solve periodic unsteady problems depends on the number of harmonics
chosen to represent the frequency content of the time signal.
In this work we investigate the accuracy and convergence properties 
of Fourier-based time integration methods. The convergence rate 
of these methods, in terms of harmonics required to describe the solution 
with a given level of accuracy, depends on the spectral content of the 
solution itself: Fourier-based time methods are particularly efficient 
for flow problems characterized by a narrow Fourier 
spectrum. Starting from this remark, we try to define a relevant 
indicator of solution regularity in the specific case of turbomachinery 
flows, which represent one of the main applications of Fourier-based 
time methods in Fluid Mechanics.
To this aim, we show that main source of unsteadiness in 
turbomachinery flows is due to the relative motion of wakes 
generated by a given blade row with respect to the downstream row. 
Statistically speaking, the passing wakes are seen by the downstream 
row as an azimuthally advected periodic Gaussian pulse, 
characterized by its relative thickness compared to the pitch 
in between two subsequent blades and by the velocity deficit 
associated to it. We show that the narrower the wake, the larger 
its Fourier spectrum, and the slower the convergence of Fourier-based time methods.
In order to achieve a priori estimates of the number of 
harmonics required to accurately solve a given turbomachinery 
problem, we introduce two error measures based on the relative 
thickness of the passing wakes. It is shown that, for practical 
purposes, these can be preliminarily estimated by running a 
companion steady simulation of the turbomachinery stage. The 
steady simulation is post-processed to extract information about 
the spanwise distribution of wake thickness, and an error criterion 
is used to estimate the number of harmonics required to resolve 99\% 
of the energy content associated to the velocity signal. The 
preliminary step has a negligible cost compared to the overall 
simulation, since the steady computation is used to initialize 
the unsteady run, and extraction of wake characteristics takes 
less than a minute on a single processor. 

The proposed methodology represents an efficient and reliable 
operational tool to guide the choice of the number of harmonics 
for a given turbomachinery problem, and to evaluate beforehand the 
interest of applying or not a Fourier-based time integration scheme 
instead of a classical time-marching scheme.}
