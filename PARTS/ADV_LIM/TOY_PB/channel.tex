\subsection{Presentation of the case}
\label{sub:presentation_of_the_case}

A channel configuration is set up to study the properties of the
Fourier-based method used here, namely the harmonic balance
method. In this 2D channel, a constant left injection is 
supplemented with an unsteady harmonic right pressure condition.
Therefore, pressure waves travel within the flow with the velocity $u + c$ and $u
- c$, where $u$ denotes the local flow velocity and $c$ the sound
velocity. Since the pressure waves are generated at the outlet, only
the $u-c$ waves are visible, resulting in pressure waves propagating
upstream of the channel, which are damped by the effect of
viscosity. Figure~\ref{fig:canal_principle} shows a sketch
of the channel case, illustrating the propagation and attenuation of
the pressure waves.

It is a 2D channel of length $L_x = 100$~m in the axial
direction and $L_z = 1$~m in the transverse one.  The boundary
conditions are: (i)~an injection condition for the inlet,
(ii)~symmetric conditions for the upper and lower bounds as the flow
is assumed to be symmetric in the transverse direction, and (iii)~a
fluctuating pressure imposed at the outlet:
\begin{equation}
  P_{outlet}(t) = P_m \cdot \left[1 + A_1 \cdot \sin(2 \pi f_1 t) +
    A_2 \cdot \sin(2 \pi f_2 t) \right],
  \label{eq:outlet_canal}
\end{equation}
where $P_m$ is the temporal average static pressure, $A_n$ the
amplitude of the $n$\textsuperscript{th} mode and $f_n$ its
frequency. The mean outlet pressure $P_m$ is set to $60\%$ of the
inlet total pressure $P_{i0} = 101,325$~Pa.

\subsection{Numerical setup}

An analytical solution is provided by \citet{Merkle1987} for
incompressible flows. However, since this toy problem is used
to assess the properties of the harmonic balance within
the Navier--Stokes equations framework, a 


% mesh presentation
The mesh consists of 1000~points along the axial direction and 10 in the
transverse one, which corresponds to equal spacings in both
directions.

This configuration is turbulent as the Reynolds number based on the
inlet flow velocity and the axial length of the channel is about $R_e
\approx 2.0 \times 10^9$.  Turbulence is modeled using the
one-equation model of Spalart and Allmaras~\cite{Spalart1992}, and the
third-order upwind Roe scheme~\cite{Roe1981} is used to compute the
convective fluxes.
