\chapter{Presentation of the toy problems}
\label{cha:toy_problems}

\chabstract{In this chapter, three toy problems are
set up to thoroughly study the properties
of the chosen harmonic balance approach. The first
toy problem is the resolution of the periodic linear advection
equation. An
analytic solution is known, allowing to accurately assess
the harmonic balance method from a theoretical point of view.
The second toy problem is a channel flow with an
oscillating back-pressure. It is solved using the 2D Navier--Stokes
equations. This allows to highlight the properties of the harmonic
balance method in a non-linear equation framework. 
Finally, the third toy problem is a model problem of a turbomachinery configuration.
A Gaussian function representative of a wake is injected and convected through
the domain using the 3D Euler equations. This test case
will be used to assess the specific problems arising when using
the harmonic balance approach in turbomachinery computations.
Furthermore, 
the solver used for these last two cases is the \emph{elsA}
code which will be used for the CROR applications.}
