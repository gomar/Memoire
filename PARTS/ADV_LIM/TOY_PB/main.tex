\chapter{Presentation of the periodic linear advection toy problem}
\label{cha:toy_problems}

\chabstract{In this chapter, a toy problem, namely
the periodic linear advection problem, is
set up to study the advantages and limitations
of the chosen harmonic balance approach. An
analytic solution is known, allowing to accurately assess
the error introduced by the harmonic balance method.}
