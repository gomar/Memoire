\chapter{Presentation of the toy problems}
\label{cha:toy_problems}

\chabstract{In this chapter, two toy problems are
set up to study the advantages and limitations
of the chosen harmonic balance approach. The first
toy problem is the resolution of the linear advection
equation. An
analytic solution is known, allowing to accurately assess
the error introduced by the harmonic balance method.
The second toy problem is a channel flow with an
oscillating back-pressure. It is solved using the 3D Navier--Stokes
equations. The solver used for this last case is the \emph{elsA}
code which is used for the CROR applications.}
