\chapter{Validation of the harmonic balance approach}
\label{cha:validation_hb}

\chabstract{In this chapter the mono- and
multi-frequential harmonic balance approaches
are validated. In this aim, two model problems are used.
Firstly, the HB method is applied to the linear advection equation 
supplemented with unsteady boundary conditions 
of different frequency content. Mono- and multi-frequential
unsteady signals are injected and compared to the
analytical results. The property of spectral accuracy is retrieve.
Moreover, the ability of the multi-frequential
approach to capture signal composed of segregated frequencies
is underlined. Based on these results, the aeroelasticity
of contra-rotating open rotors is put into perspectives.
Secondly, the multi-frequential approach is assessed on
a channel flow problem solved using the \emph{elsA}~\cite{Cambier2013}
CFD code within the Navier--Stokes equations framework. The results
are shown to be superimposed with a classical time-marching solution.}
