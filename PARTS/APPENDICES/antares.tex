\label{app:antares}

Antares is a pre and post-processing tool written in full python.
Developed by Adrien Gomar and Thomas LÃ©onard since march 2012, 
it has become a mature tool that is now supervised by
CERFACS.

Originally, Antares has been designed to simply put
numerical simulation results into the NumPy world. 
Using the large choice of functions 
available within the NumPy framework and the Python community,
efficient, readable and re-usable data analysis processing can be performed.
Supplemented with a CGNS like API, you get an easy-to-use data structure
that can be used to build complex data analysis procedures.

This generic framework allows its use for steady/unsteady results and
multiple type of applications and codes.
