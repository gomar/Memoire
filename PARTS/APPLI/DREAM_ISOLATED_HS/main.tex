\chapter{Isolated high-speed CROR configuration}
\label{cha:dream_hs_isolated}

\chabstract{To further assess the proposed
multi-frequential harmonic balance method along
with a weak-coupling approach, a more demanding
case is studied, namely a high-speed configuration.
The number of harmonics required to compute such a
configuration is shown to be higher than the 
low-speed configuration. The unsteady rigid
computations are analyzed and aeroelastic
simulations are then launched, showing that 
the proposed approach is robust enough to 
assess such configurations.}

\chconclu{The multi-frequential harmonic balance
method along with a weak-coupling approach has been
assessed on a high-speed CROR configuration. First,
the steady computations reveal strong non-linear 
features, namely shocks. The prediction tool
defined in Chap.~\ref{cha:limitations_convergence}
is then used to estimate the number 
of harmonics required to simulate the configuration.
No intermediate simulation is launched and the results
are shown to be consistent, namely the tip vortex interaction
is captured. 
Aeroelastic simulations are then launched.
The results are finally assessed by post-processing the integrated damping
and the local excitation of the blades.
This configuration is also shown to be flutter free.}
