The same topology and number of grid points is used to
mesh this high-speed configuration. The reader is referred to 
Sec.~\ref{sec:dream_ls_numerical} for detailed information.

\paragraph{Influence of the spatial discretization}
\label{sub:dream_hs_spatial_discretization}

To assess the different spatial scheme for this high-speed
CROR configuration, the same exercise as done in 
Sec.~\ref{sub:dream_ls_spatial_discretization} is made below.
The same four schemes are evaluated based 
on the convergence of the computation
and the convergence of the integrated 
results (similarity coefficients).
For the \citet{Jameson1981} scheme, the artificial viscosities
are chosen as follow: $\kappa_2 = 1.0$ as the configuration is likely to 
see shocks and $\kappa_4 = 0.016$. We will see that the computation converges
with this low $\kappa_4$ coefficient. Therefore, only this coefficient
will be tested.

The convergence of the computations using the four spatial schemes
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DREAM_HS_RESIDUALS_PPT}. The convergence is good
for all the spatial schemes. In fact, more than five order of magnitude
is lost on the residuals.

The values of the similarity coefficients obtained with
all the spatial schemes is reported in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:dream_hs_space_scheme_coeff}. The values are
given as a ratio over the Roe~2 values. The first order
upwind scheme (Roe~1) give similarity coefficients that are
several percent lower than the Roe~2 value. The other schemes
give results that are less than 1\% close, therefore and for
consistence with the approach retained for the LS configuration
the Roe~2 scheme is chosen for the following results.
