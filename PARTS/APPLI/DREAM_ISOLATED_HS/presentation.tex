The configuration studied in this Chapter is the same as the
previous one but with a different angle of attack of
the blades. The geometry is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dream_hs_wall}.
This geometry is the High-Speed (HS) version of the previous one, 
representative of the cruise flight condition. The rotation speed being kept
almost constant between the two configurations, the only way to ensure
a proper adaptation of the velocity field is to change the angle of 
attack the blades.

The main input parameters of the case are recalled in
Tab.~\ref{tab:dream_hs_flight_condition}.
\begin{table}[htp]

  \begin{tabular}{cccc}
    \toprule
    $M_0$ & $|\Omega|$ & $J$ & $M_{tip}$ \\
    \midrule
    $0.73$ & $6057$ RPM & 3.7 & 0.96  \\

The inflow Mach number is within the transonic range. Its high value
can suggest the appearance of shocks in the flow field. 
This is emphasized by the $M_{tip}$ which is
near from being supersonic.
