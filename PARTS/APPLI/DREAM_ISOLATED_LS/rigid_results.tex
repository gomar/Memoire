\subsection{Spectral convergence of the harmonic balance computations} 
\label{sub:dream_ls_hb_convergence}

The prediction tool developed in 
Sec.~\ref{sub:prediction_tool_azimuthal_fft} is applied
to the studied configuration to evaluate the
required number of harmonics needed for the
harmonic balance approach to be converged.
The result is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DREAM_LS_RANS_ROE2_SPECTRUM_PPT}.
To capture 99\% of the energy, four harmonics are needed, even though
at a relative span superior to 60\%, only three harmonics would be needed.
However, as the implementation of the harmonic balance used
in this work does not allow a varying number of harmonics through the
configuration, four harmonics is the supposed converged value.
