\subsection{Spectral convergence of the harmonic balance computations} 
\label{sub:dream_ls_hb_convergence}

The prediction tool developed in 
Sec.~\ref{sub:prediction_tool_azimuthal_fft} is applied
to the studied configuration to evaluate the
required number of harmonics needed for the
harmonic balance approach to be converged.
The result is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DREAM_LS_RANS_ROE2_SPECTRUM_PPT}.
To capture 99\% of the energy, four harmonics are needed, even though
at a relative span superior to 60\%, only three harmonics would be needed.
However, as the implementation of the harmonic balance used
in this work does not allow a varying number of harmonics through the
configuration, four harmonics is supposed to be sufficient to efficiently 
represent the unsteady flow field.

The computations have been run in different manners. First the steady computation
is run
