\subsection{Estimation of the number of harmonic needed} 
\label{sub:estimation_of_the_number_of_harmonic_needed}

The prediction tool developed in 
Sec.~\ref{sub:prediction_tool_azimuthal_fft} is applied
to the studied configuration to evaluate the
required number of harmonics needed for the
harmonic balance approach to be converged.
The result is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DREAM_LS_RANS_ROE2_SPECTRUM_PPT}.
To capture 99\% of the energy, four harmonics are needed, even though
at a relative span superior to 60\%, only three harmonics would be needed.
