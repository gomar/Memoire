The following applications have been performed using the
\emph{elsA}\footnote{\emph{elsA} stands for \underline{e}nsemble 
\underline{l}ogiciel pour la \underline{s}imulation en 
\underline{A}\'erodynamique} solver~\cite{Cambier2013} initially developed by ONERA in 1997.
Since then, CERFACS became a co-developer of \emph{elsA} in 2001 among with other academical
and industrial partners.
This code solves the Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes equations 
using a cell-centered finite-volume approach on multi-blocks structured meshes.
