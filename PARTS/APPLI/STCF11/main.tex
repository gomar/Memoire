\label{cha:stcf11}

\chabstract{The approach retained in this thesis, namely using
the harmonic balance with a weak coupling approach is validated
against experimental results in this chapter. To do so,
the famous 11\textsuperscript{th} standard configuration of
\citet{Fransson1999} is used. It is shown that by using only
one harmonic ($N=1$), the damping curve of both the subsonic
and the transonic operating point is predicted. The agreement
with both the experimental and the numerical data available
is very good, justifying the proposed approach.}
