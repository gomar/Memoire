\chabstract{The harmonic balance method along with a aeroelastic 
weak-coupling approach, is applied to
the well-known 11\textsuperscript{th} standard aeroelastic configuration of
\citet{Fransson1999} is used. It is shown that by using only
one harmonic ($N=1$), the damping curve of both the subsonic
and the transonic operating points are superimposed on
the reference unsteady computation. The agreement
with both the experimental and the numerical data available
is good, justifying the proposed approach. Moreover, a
speed-up of seven is found compared to a classical 
time-marching scheme. This work has been published in

\chconclu{The use of harmonic balance approach
to compute turbomachinery aeroelasticity has been validated
against a well documented test case. The results
are in good agreement with the experimental data and with
numerical results obtained by using other approaches.
The harmonic balance approach
has shown that with only one harmonic, the damping curve
is retrieved compared to a classical time-marching scheme.
The speed-up obtained is seven. This give us faith to
apply the current approach to more demanding aeroelastic
computations, namely contra-rotating open rotor
aeroelasticity.}
