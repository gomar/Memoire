\chapter{Introduction}

Global warming could be one of the biggest challenge human kind
may have to face in the forthcoming decades if not years.
In fact, according to the last scientific
report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC)~\cite{IPCC2013}
"Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, 
and since the 1950s, many of the observed 
changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia".
"It is extremely likely that human influence has 
been the dominant cause of the 
observed warming since the mid-20\textsuperscript{th} 
century".
"The largest contribution to total radiative 
forcing is caused by the increase in the atmospheric 
concentration of $CO_2$ since 1750".

A part of these pollutant emissions comes from the
transport industry and in particular the
aeronautical industry. 
For that reason, the European commission has set
demanding objectives for 2050 on the pollutant emissions
through the
Advisory Council for 
Aeronautics Research in Europe (ACARE):
the noise, $CO_2$ and $NO_x$ emissions should be reduced by 
$65\%$, $75\%$ and $80\%$ respectively
(Figure~\ref{fig:flightpath_2050}).

Hopefully for the earth,
the rarefaction of crude oil accelerates the decision making.
In particular, in the seventies, the two oil crisis showed the aeronautical 
industries its dependence toward energy resources. 
To face this issue, the U.S. Senate directed NASA in 1975
to look for every potential fuel-saving concept for aircraft
engines. The Advanced Turboprop
project was born~\cite{Hager1988} and led to the
concept of contra-rotating open rotor. This new
engine concept showed large fuel savings
along with higher noise emissions due to the absence of
a duct. Combined with the decrease of the price of the
barrel in the late eighties, the contra-rotating open rotor 
never reached the commercial aviation.

Today, the cost of a barrel is almost at its maximum as shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:crude_oil_price}.

In parallel, Airbus forecast a doubled number of passengers in
$2031$. Therefore, to allow a sustainable air transportation, new
concepts are needed for both the engines and the 
aircraft in general.
Several have emerged among which: lightweight construction
with advanced composite structure, airport collaborative decision
making with continuous climb departure and less waiting in taxi,
aerodynamically optimized wing geometries as laminar wings for instance
and finally, full efficient engines to name but a few.
In this last field, two main type of engines are currently studied: the
High ByPass Ratio (HBPR) engine that is based on a
large diameter engine, improving thus the
propulsive efficiency and the Contra-Rotating Open Rotor (CROR)
engine that relies on two rows of contra-rotating propellers
that proves its efficiency during experiments in the
eighties.


The industrial design of turbomachinery, and by extension contra-rotating
open rotors, is usually based on steady flow analysis, 
for which the reference simulation tool are the three-dimensio\-nal Reynolds-Averaged 
Navier--Stokes (RANS) steady computations. However, this approach finds its limits 
when unsteady phenomena become dominant. This is the case of 
contra-rotating open rotors where the interaction between the
two rotors is of prior importance.
In such a context, engineers now 
need to account for unsteady-flow effects as early as possible in the design 
cycle, which makes efficiency of unsteady computations a key issue. 
A specificity of turbomachinery flows is their periodicity, 
at least as far as the mean field properties are considered. 

Several unsteady approaches to simulate CROR configurations
have been investigated at CERFACS during the
last four years: \citet{Burnazzi2010} evaluated the phase-lag approach
applied to 3D contra-rotating open rotor configuration and showed
that unsteadinesses can be captured using a mesh that only spans one
blade-passage per row. 
Some years ago, \citet{ThesisSicot} implemented a 
Fourier-based time method, namely the Harmonic Balance (HB),
into the \emph{elsA} CFD code that is used at CERFACS. Applied to turbomachinery
configurations, this method showed a computational gain
of one to two orders of magnitude 
compared to classical time-marching approaches.
This is why, in the continuity of the work
of \citet{Burnazzi2010}, \citet{Yabili2010} assessed 
the harmonic balance approach applied to 
a $2.5$D radial slice of a CROR configuration. 
The capability
of the HB approach to efficiently retrieve the unsteadinesses
at a lower cost, compared to classical time-marching approach,
 was not conclusive.
Therefore, \citet{ThesisFrancois}
investigated classical unsteady approaches for
turbomachinery computations applied to CROR simulations
among which the HB approach in his PhD thesis. 
He showed that
the harmonic balance method can retrieve unsteady
flow features for a reduced cost but at a gain that
is relatively smaller compared to what was
obtained on former turbomachinery applications. 
In parallel, \citet{ThesisGuedeney} extended the harmonic
balance approach to a multi-frequential framework. 
This method allows then to compute unsteadinesses whose frequencies
are not harmonically related.

Several challenges, such as aerodynamic,
aeroacoustic and aeroelasticity are still open 
for contra-rotating open rotor
to become a viable engine for the next generation aircraft.
In this PhD thesis, we propose to assess the aeroelasticity of 
contra-rotating open rotor by using the multi-frequential
harmonic balance developed by \citet{ThesisGuedeney}.
In fact, the main unsteadinesses of the flow field
are known to be correlated with the so-called
blade passing frequency. This frequency depends on the
rotation speed of the rotor and the number of blades
of the opposite rotor. In contrast to that, the 
frequency that drives the aeroelasticity of CROR
blades depends on their structural properties.
As such, the frequencies of both the aerodynamic
field and the aeroelasticity are not harmonically
related and justifies the use of the multi-frequential
formulation of the harmonic balance approach.


The aim of this PhD thesis is to assess the
multi-frequential harmonic balance developed at CERFACS
to estimate the flutter properties of contra-rotating open rotor
configurations. The memoir is divided in three parts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the first part presents general information on 
	contra-rotating open rotors (Chapter~\ref{cha:cror}),
