What a pleasure to finally write those lines !! This means that
the end is close ;)
I will try to make this quick, even though everyone knows that this
is the part that will be the most read in this PhD, starting by you ;)

First, I want to especially thank the members of the jury. I have been
delighted by the meticulous review made by Professor Li He and Professor 
Christophe Corre on this PhD thesis. Your remarks, observations
and questions
have participated to make this manuscript more complete and accurate, and
for that I thank you.
Then I want to thank the other members of the Jury: Pascal Ferrand, 
Jean-Camille Chassaing and Clément Dejeu for being here on D-Day,
for the chats that we had
and for the kind words that you told. This PhD defense day will remain as one of the
best days of my life, yet stressful.

As for the PhD defense, I will now switch in French as it will
be easier for me to make proper acknowledgments.
