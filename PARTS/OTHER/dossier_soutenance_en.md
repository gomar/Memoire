Multi-frequential Harmonic Balance Approach for the Simulation of Contra-Rotating Open Rotors : Application to Aeroelasticity

# Abstract of the thesis

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has allowed the optimization of many configurations among which aircraft engines. In the aeronautical industry, CFD is mostly restricted to steady approaches due to the high computational cost of unsteady simulations. Nevertheless, the flow field across the rotating parts of aircraft engines, namely turbomachinery blades, is essentially periodic in time. Years ago, Fourier-based time methods have been developed to take advantage of this time periodicity. However, they are restricted to mono-frequential flow fields for the most part. This means that only a single base-frequency and its harmonics are considered. Recently, a multi-frequential Fourier-based time method, namely the multi-frequential Harmonic Balance (HB), has been developed and implemented into the elsA CFD code, enabling new kinds of applications and, specifically, the aeroelasticity of multi-stage turbomachinery. 
The present PhD thesis aims at applying the HB approach to the aeroelasticity of a new type of aircraft engine: the contra-rotating open rotor. The method is first validated on analytical and linear and non-linear numerical test problems. Two issues are raised, which prevent the use of such an approach on industrial configurations: the conditioning problem and the convergence of the method. Original methodologies are developed to improve the condition number of the simulations and to provide a priori estimates of the number of harmonics required to achieve a given convergence level. The HB method is then validated for a standard configuration for turbomachinery aeroelasticity. The results are shown to be in fair agreement with the experimental data. The applicability of the method is finally demonstrated for aeroelastic simulations of contra-rotating open rotors.
