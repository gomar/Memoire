Multi-frequential Harmonic Balance Approach for the Simulation of Contra-Rotating Open Rotors : Application to Aeroelasticity

# Abstract of the thesis

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has allowed the optimization of many configurations among which aircraft engines.
In the aeronautical industry, CFD is mostly restricted to steady approaches due to the expensive cost of unsteady simulations.
Nevertheless, the flow field that develops in the rotating parts of aircraft engines, namely turbomachinery, is mainly periodic in time.
Years ago, Fourier-based time methods have been developed by taking advantage of this time periodicity.
However, they are restricted to mono-frequential flow fields for the most part. This means that only a single base-frequency and its harmonics are considered.
Recently, a multi-frequential Fourier-based time method, namely the multi-frequential Harmonic Balance (HB), has been developed and implemented into the elsA CFD code, enabling new kind of applications.
In particular, the aeroelasticity of multi-stage turbomachinery.

The present PhD thesis aims at applying the HB approach to the aeroelasticity of a new type of aircraft engine: the contra-rotating open rotor.
The method is first validated on analytical and linear and non-linear numerical toy problems.
Two issues are raised, which prevent the use of such an approach on industrial configurations: the condition number and the convergence of the method.
Innovative solution are presented that enables the use of the proposed approach.
The method is then validated on a standard configuration for turbomachinery aeroelasticity. The results are shown to be in fair agreement with the experimental data.
The applicability of the method is finally demonstrated on the simulation of contra-rotating open rotors aeroelasticity.
