\subsection{Forced response}
\label{sub:forced_response}

As shown previously in Sec.~\ref{sec:cror_unsteady}, wakes and
potentials effects give rise to unsteady fluctuations in 
CROR configurations. These fluctuations 
can generate large vibration levels on the blades.
When the assembly modes are excited by the rotation speed
or its multiples, resonance can occur,
hence the term forced response. 
The frequency associated to the rotation speed or its multiples
is called Engine Order (EO).
At design, one step to minimize forced response is
to use the Campbell diagram show in Fig.~\ref{fig:campbell}
which schematically represents such resonance.
Blue points shows the crossing of engine order and 
the blade eigenfrequencies within the operating range. 
The Campbell diagram does not give any information of
the absolution level of vibration. Therefore, it is mostly
used to rank potential designs~\cite{Marshall1996}. This phenomena
will not be studied in this thesis.

\subsection{Flutter}
\label{sub:flutter}

Flutter is defined as a self-excited, unstable 
self-sustained vibration. In turbomachinery, this is
more likely to appear on blades.
One of the most impressive
manifestation of flutter occurred November 7\textsuperscript{th}, 1940.
Four month after being build, the bridge experienced 
torsional flutter excited by a $64$ \mbox{km/h} wind.
The first and second torsional modes were observed.
A few hours latter, the bridge felt down as seen in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:tacoma_bridge}. Hopefully, no human
was injured, but this event showed the importance
of taking into account the flutter phenomenon as
it is a very energetic event and can lead to the destruction of the system.

  \label{fig:tacoma_bridge}
\end{figure}

Three vibration scenarios can appear for flutter.
The first scenario is the damped (or positively damped) 
vibration meaning
that the amplitude fo vibration decreases with respect to time, 
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:flutter_damped}.
This is the most wanted behavior as the system tends to
as stable point. In this case, the blade is said to
be flutter-free for the studied mode.
The second scenario is the amplified (or negatively damped)
vibration as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:flutter_amplified}. 
This was the scenario that occurred on the Tacoma bridge. 
This scenario ultimately
leads to failure which is not acceptable. This is particularly true
on CROR configuration, as a blade failure might lead to 
the crash of the airplane as detailed in Sec.~\ref{sec:cror_challenges}.
The last scenario is the Limit Cycle Oscillation (LCO) vibration.
In this scenario, the deformation increases until a certain 
amplitude and then stays constant. This scenario is not
destructive by essence compared to the amplified scenario. However,
if the blade is repetitively excited by LCO, the blade
can fail as a consequence of structure fatigue.

\end{figure}

The development of one scenario over another one is linked to
the fluid response to the vibration of the blade. In fact,
if the aerodynamic loads projected on the direction of the vibration
is positive, this means that the displacement will be amplified. 
In opposite, if the force is in opposed direction, the vibration will be damped.
The out-of-phase component of the aerodynamic force compared to
the displacement vector will give finally the sign of the aerodynamic damping.
The amplitude will give its strength. 

In this thesis, only the flutter boundary is assessed. In fact,
LCO can only be computed using a strong coupled fluid-structure 
approach and a weak coupling approach is chosen in this thesis
as detailed in the following Section.
