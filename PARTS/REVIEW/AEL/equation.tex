The governing equation of the dynamic aeroelasticity is
the combination of the fluid dynamics and the solid mechanics
equations:
\begin{equation}
	m \ddot{x} + c \dot{x} + k x = F(t)
	\label{eq:ael_motion_eq}
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the mass, $c$ the damping, $k$ the stiffness, $x$ the deformation
coordinate and $F(t)$ the aerodynamic force, which is governed
by the Navier--Stokes equations. In this equation, $m$
and $k$ are characteristics of the material.
