From a structural point of view, the aeroelasticity
of turbomachineries is governed by:
\begin{equation}
	M \vec{\ddot{x}} + d \vec{\dot{x}} + k \vec{x} = \vec{F}_a(t)
	\label{eq:ael_motion_eq}
\end{equation}
where $m$, $d$ and $k$ are the mass, the damping and the stiffness matrices, respectively.
$\vec{x}$ and $\vec{F}_a(t)$ denote the displacement and force vectors.
Let us note that $k$ is the structural, not aerodynamical damping.
The force vector $\vec{F}_a(t)$ is governed by the Navier--Stokes
equations, hence the coupling.
