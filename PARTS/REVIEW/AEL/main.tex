\chapter{Introduction to turbomachinery aeroelasticity}
\label{cha:ael}

\chabstract{In this chapter, the basic elements
to understand turbomachinery are detailed. Firstly, the
definition and the basic equation that drives dynamic
aeroelasticity are presented. The two principal aeroelastic
phenomena that develop in turbomachines are then presented.
The flutter is assessed in this thesis and the computational
approach retained to compute it, namely the weak-coupling approach,
is presented. The variables that are used to quantify the 
flutter boundary are finally presented.}
