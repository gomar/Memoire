\chapter{Introduction to aeroelasticity}
\label{cha:ael}

\chabstract{In this chapter, the basic elements
to understand aeroelasticity in turbomachinery and by extension
in CROR are detailed. Firstly, the
definition and the basic equations governing dynamic
aeroelasticity are presented. The two main aeroelastic
phenomena that develop in turbomachinery,
forced response and flutter, are then presented.
The latter is investigated in this thesis and the computational
approach retained to compute it, namely the weak-coupling approach,
is presented. The variables that are used to quantify the 
flutter boundary are finally presented.}
