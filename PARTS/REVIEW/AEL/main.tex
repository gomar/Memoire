\chapter{Introduction to aeroelasticity}
\label{cha:ael}

\chabstract{In this chapter, the basic elements
to understand aeroelasticity in turbomachinery and by extension
in CROR are detailed. Firstly, the
definition and the basic equations governing dynamic
aeroelasticity are presented. The two main aeroelastic
phenomena that develop in turbomachinery,
namely forced response and flutter, are then presented.
The latter is investigated in this thesis and the computational
approach retained to compute it, namely the weak-coupling approach,
is presented. The variables that are used to quantify the 
flutter boundary are finally presented.}

\chconclu{The weak-coupling approach has been described in this
chapter. It is the method that will be used in this work to
assess the flutter of contra-rotating open rotors. The 
formula to compute the damping within the weak-coupling
approach has been given. In the next chapter, Fourier-based
time methods will be presented as they are good candidates
to efficiently simulation the aeroelasticity of contra-rotating
open rotors.}
