\chapter{Introduction to aeroelasticity}
\label{cha:ael}

\chabstract{In this chapter, the basic elements
to understand aeroelasticity in turbomachinery and by extension
in CROR are detailed. Firstly, the
definition and the basic equations that drive dynamic
aeroelasticity are presented. The two principal aeroelastic
phenomena that develop in turbomachinery are then presented.
The flutter is assessed in this thesis and the computational
approach retained to compute it, namely the weak-coupling approach,
is presented and the variables that are used to quantify the 
flutter boundary are finally presented.}
