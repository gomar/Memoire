The aeroelasticity, also called dynamic aeroelasticity,
is the interaction of three forces:
the aerodynamic ($\mathcal{A}$), the elastic ($\mathcal{E}$) and
the inertial forces ($\mathcal{I}$) as 
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ael_collar_triangle}.

This is thus a 
multi-physical problem involving the field of fluid dynamics and
solid mechanics.
