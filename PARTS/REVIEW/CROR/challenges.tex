Several challenges are still open for CROR
to become a viable engine for the next generation aircraft.
In this way, we classify and describe each of them in the following sections.

\paragraph{Classification}
Figure~\ref{fig:cror_challenges} depicts the current challenges associated
with CROR configurations. Three main fields are involved: the aerodynamics, the
aeroelastics and the aeroacoustics fields.

\paragraph{Aerodynamic}
Theoretically, 
the CROR is meant to have a better propulsive efficiency than a turbofan or a
propeller. However, as it is a new architecture, studies need to be conducted
to understand the flow physic that develops within it. In particular,
the aerodynamic interaction between the two rotors needs to be understand.
\citet{Hendricks2011} developed an open-rotor cycle model based
on experimental performance characteristics made at NASA. This is 
an empiric approach that suffers from the impossibility to build new designs.
\citet{Peters2012} developed an equivalent code to design their CROR but the
final design is assessed for aeroacoustic purposes by full annulus unsteady simulations.
To improve this, \citet{Bechet2011} used a lifting-line code to
initialize a gradient optimization procedure based on mixing-plane
computations. This last step allows to gain almost a half point of
the CROR efficiency. This is more general than an empiric strategy
if the mixing-plane computations are reliable to assess the performance
parameters of CROR. This study has been performed by \citet{Zachariadis2011}.
They compared the performance prediction of mixing plane computations
to experimental data made on a open-rotor test case.
The agreement is fair for the thrust and power coefficients.
As small discrepancies are present, these are amplified when computing
the efficiency which is basically the ratio of the two coefficients.
\citet{Vion2011} and \citet{Stuermer2008} used unsteady
CFD computations to assess the unsteady performance and flow features.
\citet{Stuermer2008} and \citet{Francois2013} demonstrated through a code to code comparison
that CFD was mature enough to estimate the in-plane forces.

\paragraph{Aeroacoustic}
Lot of research effort is put on the third challenge which
is aeroacoustic due to the absence of a duct. 
In fact, in the late eighties at NASA, \citet{Hager1988}
conducted a large project on innovative propulsion systems for the
next generation aircrafts. The potential of the CROR configuration
was identified but the noise emitted was so high that the only way
thought to use such an engine was to put noise limiter in the fuselage. It results in 
an increase of the weight. Together with the decrease of the price of the
barrel in the late eighties, the CROR never reached the commercial
aviation. This is why, today, a lot of research effort is put on the
understanding and mastering of noise sources in CRORs.
Two main type of noise have been identified: tonal noise which comes from
the interaction of both rotors and is mainly present at low-speed flight conditions 
(namely take-off)
and broadband noise which comes from turbulence and is predominant
at high-speed flight conditions (namely cruise).
Several CFD studies have been performed in the literature.
\citet{Peters2012} showed that unsteady CFD simulation is able
to reproduce the aeroacoustic footprint of a CROR. They then optimized
their CROR and showed that optimized CROR design may be mature enough
for noise certification. \citet{Hoffer2012} and \citet{Ferrante2013}
developed an efficient CFD approach to simulation the aeroacoutic of CRORs.
It is based on a Fourier-based time method. The approach is able to
take into account for incidence effects which is particularly interesting
considering that the noise of installed configuration is drastically
different from the isolated one (see \citet{Hager1988}).

\paragraph{Aeroelastic}
The second challenge is the less studied in the numerical literature.
This why, in this thesis, the aeroelasticity of CROR will be assessed.
Two main aeroelastic phenomena have been identified during preliminary studies
during the eighties by \citet{Hager1988}: the whirl flutter which is the self-excited
movement of the whole nacelle and the blade flutter which is the vibration, also
self-excited, of the blades.
For a turbofan engine to achieve certification, it must be demonstrated that one released fan blade can be safely contained within the engineâ€™s fan case as written in the 
Certification Specifications for Engines of the EASA:
\begin{quote}
	"It must be demonstrated that any single compressor or turbine blade will be contained after Failure and 
that no Hazardous Engine Effect can arise as a result of other Engine damage likely to occur before 
Engine shut down following a blade Failure"
\end{quote}
In the case of propellers and contra-rotating open rotors, due to the absence of a nacelle,
this can not be done. To achieve certification, it must be demonstrated that the probability of a blade
failure (or any failure) should not exceed $1e^{-8}$ per Propeller flight hour as written in 
the Certification Specifications for Propellers of the EASA:
\begin{quote}
	"It must be shown that Hazardous Propeller Effects will not occur at a rate in excess of that defined 
as Extremely Remote. The estimated probability for individual failures may be insufficiently precise 
to enable the total rate for Hazardous Propeller Effects to be assessed. For Propeller certification, it 
is acceptable to consider that the intent of this paragraph is achieved if the probability of a 
Hazardous Propeller Effect arising from an individual failure can be predicted to be not greater than 
$1e^{-8}$ per Propeller flight hour. It will also be accepted that, in dealing with probabilities of this low 
order of magnitude, absolute proof is not possible and reliance must be placed on engineering 
judgment and previous experience combined with sound design and test philosophies." 
\end{quote}
This explains why aeroelasticity of contra-rotating open rotors should be assessed.
However, this challenge is less studied in the literature.
To the author knowledge, only whirl flutter has been investigated
in the CROR literature by \citet{CISicot2011a} and \citet{Verley2013} and this study mainly
discusses the simulation tools needed to compute such a phenomena as
no experimental data are available.
