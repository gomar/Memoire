\chapter{Contra-rotating open rotors}
\label{cha:cror}

\chabstract{The advantage of propeller based engine
is demonstrated through the use of the thrust and propulsive efficiency
equations. The geometry of propellers is first presented, 
following by the main physical phenomena that develop 
in this system through, finally,
the estimation of the performance parameters. Contra-rotating
open rotors are then presented as an extension of propellers.
A specific emphasis is put on the unsteady phenomena
that develops in a CROR and the challenges associated to these
to become a viable future aircraft engine.}

\chconclu{The main flow physic that develop in contra-rotating open rotors
has been detailed. The unsteady phenomena that develops through this
engine are mostly correlated with the blade passing frequency, except for
the installation effects and the non-uniform inflow. The challenges
associated with this type of engine are recalled and it is highlighted 
that aeroelasticity of such systems remain unstudied. This is
why the present thesis will focus on aeroelasticity.}
