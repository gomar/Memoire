\chapter{Contra-rotating open rotors}
\label{cha:cror}

\chabstract{In this chapter, we first recall the thrust
and propulsive efficiency equations. Using these equations,
the propeller engines are shown to be good candidates
for efficient engines, mainly due to its high bypass ratio.
The geometry, general principle, similarity coefficients
and main physical phenomena of such engines are 
highlighted. In addition to that, it is shown that even if efficient,
the propeller engines suffer from a residual swirl motion.
To tackle this problem, the contra-rotating open rotor
technology is presented as long with its main source of unsteadiness.
The challenges associated to this engine are finally detailed
and we show that aeroelasticity needs to be accounted for.}

% \chconclu{The main flow physic that develops in contra-rotating open rotors
% has been described. The unsteady phenomena that develops through this
% engine are mostly correlated with the blade passing frequency, except for
% the installation effects and the non-uniform inflow. The challenges
% associated with this type of engine are recalled and it is highlighted 
% that aeroelasticity of such systems remain unstudied. This is
% why the present thesis will focus on aeroelasticity.}
