\chapter{Contra-rotating open rotors}
\label{cha:cror}

\chabstract{The advantage of propeller based engine
is demonstrated through the use of the thrust and propulsive efficiency
formula. The propeller is first detailed from its geometry, 
to the main physical phenomena that develop in this system through
the estimation of the performance parameters. Contra-rotating
open rotors are then detailed as an extension of propellers.
A specific attention is put on the unsteady phenomena
that develops in a CROR and the challenges associated to these
to become a viable future aircraft engine.}

\chconclu{The main flow physic of contra-rotating open rotors
has been detailed. The unsteady phenomena that develops through this
engine are mostly correlated with the blade passing frequency, except
the installation effects and the non-uniform inflow. The challenges
associated with this type of engine are recalled and highlighted is the
fact that aeroelasticity of such systems remain unknown. This is
why the present thesis will focus on aeroelasticity.}
