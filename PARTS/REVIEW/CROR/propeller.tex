\subsection{Geometry}
\label{sub:cror_propeller_geometry}

A propeller is composed of one single rotor with blades
attached on it as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:cror_propeller_geometry}. 
The diameter of these blades is $D$
and their rotation speed is $\Omega$. 
A In front of the propeller, there is a spinner which helps
smoothing the air inflow.
The turboprop engine can be seen as
a turbofan whose fan is not within a nacelle.

The absence of a nacelle implies that theoretically, the mass-flow can be
infinite. To quantify this, it is common in the engine field to
consider the bypass ratio. It is defined as the ratio between the
cold air (the un-combustioned air)
divided by the hot air (the air that goes through the engine core).
One of the highest bypass ratio engine on aircraft today is given
by the Pratt~\&~Whitney~PW1000G and is~12, while propellers are estimated
to have a bypass ratio of~50. This explains why this architecture has
regain interest.

\subsection{Velocity triangle}
\label{sub:cror_propeller_velocity_triangle}
The velocity triangle applied to a propeller configuration
is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:cror_velocity_triangle_propeller}.
The aim of a propeller is to create a thrust through a increase
in the axial velocity note $\Delta V_x$ is the diagram. To do
so, the relative flow field is straighten up. This gives both
a increase in axial velocity but also in tangential velocity.
In fact, the inflow that was purely axial has a tangential
component at the outlet. This is called the swirl and
is a lost energy as it cannot be used to produce thrust.

\subsection{Similarity coefficients}
\label{sub:similarity_coefficients}
To estimate the characteristics of the propeller, four similarity
coefficients are used:
the advance ratio $J$ that represents the operating point of the propeller,
the thrust $C_t$ and power $C_p$ coefficients that estimate its performance and finally
the efficiency $\eta$:
\begin{equation}
    J = \frac{V_0}{n D}, \quad
    C_t = \frac{F_x}{\frac{1}{2} n ^ 2  D ^ 4}, \quad
    C_p = \frac{M_x \Omega}{\frac{1}{2} n ^ 3 D ^ 5}, \quad
    \eta = J \frac{C_t}{C_p},
\end{equation}
where $V_0$ is the free-stream velocity 
(depicted in Fig.~\ref{sub:cror_propeller_geometry}), 
$n$ the rotation frequency ($n = \Omega / 2 \pi$) and
$M_x$ the axial torque.
The efficiency defined here is the global propulsive efficiency
as it gives the ratio of the propulsive power over the mechanical power.

An estimation of the variation of the advance ratio $J$ and the 
efficiency $\eta$ depending on the flight conditions can be given as follow
\begin{alignat}{4}
    \text{(cruise)} \quad  0.8 &< \eta &< 0.95, \quad 1 &< J < 3.5 \\
    \text{(take-off)} \quad  0.5 &< \eta &< 0.8, \quad J &< 1.
\end{alignat}
