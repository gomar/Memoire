\subsection{From steady to unsteady phenomena}
\label{sub:cror_from_steady_to_unsteady_phenomena}

The flow generated behind the front rotor
is steady in its frame of reference. Nevertheless,
due to the relative speed difference between the
front and the rear rotors, these steady flow distortions are
seen as unsteady features by the rear rotor. 
These unsteadinesses are correlated with the Blade Passing Frequency (BPF):
\begin{equation}
	f_{BPF} = \frac{\Omega_{rel} B_{opp}}{2 \pi},
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_{rel}$ is the relative speed difference between
the current and the opposite row
and $B_{opp}$ the number of blades in the opposite row.

\subsection{Main unsteadinesses}
\label{sub:cror_main_unsteadinesses}

In sec.~\ref{sub:cror_propeller_physics}, the main physical phenomena
that appear in a propeller have been introduced. As seen above, due to
the relative speed difference between the two rotors, these phenomena
that were steady in their frame of reference are now seen as unsteady features
by the rear rotor. As such, to numerically simulate them, unsteady computations
will be needed. In this aim, the following section will be devoted to the classification
of unsteady phenomena that appear in CROR in 
order to choose an efficient strategy to simulate them.

\paragraph{Tip vortices}

As shown previously in Fig.~\ref{fig:propeller_tip_vortices}, tip vortices are formed
at blade tips due to the pressure difference between each side of the blades.
If nothing particular is done, this perturbation can
hit the rear rotor and induce large unsteady fluctuations. To avoid this,
the rear rotor blades are clipped as mentioned earlier. 
This unsteadiness is correlated with the BPF.

\paragraph{Wakes and potential effects}

Compared to an isolated rotor, as for the case of a propeller,
the presence of the rear rotor gives rise to an unsteady
interaction by means of potential effects. In addition, wakes generated
behind the front rotor interact with the rear rotor.
This is schematically represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:cror_wakes_potential}.
\begin{figure}[htp]

  \caption{Wakes and potential effects in a 
  contra-rotating open rotor configuration.}
  \label{fig:cror_wakes_potential}
\end{figure}
These two phenomena are correlated with the blade passing frequency.
In addition to this, vortex shedding phenomena may occur behind the blades, 
whose frequency is not known \emph{a priori}.
This phenomenon is more likely to appear behind blades with a bluff trailing edge.
This is not a common design in industrial configurations as a bluff trailing edge
gives larger drag. Therefore, we can consider here that 
wake and potential effects are the driving unsteady phenomena
that are correlated with the blade passing frequency.

\paragraph{Non-uniform inflow and installation effects}

In maneuver, the CROR is in incidence with respect to the incoming flow
which results in a non-uniform velocity triangle on the blades.
This leads to in-plane forces, which is an unsteady phenomenon
whose frequency is correlated with the rotation frequency $\Omega / 2 \pi$.
The presence of a pylon (installation effect) give rises to an unsteady frequency
also correlated with the rotation frequency when a pusher CROR is considered.
It is important as it changes the performances and flow behavior around the CROR.
