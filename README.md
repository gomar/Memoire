# PhD memoire

Since [git](https://git-scm.com) is awesome at tracking text files and a LaTeX document is written using text files, I thought it would be nice to track my PhD thesis writing using git.

The final document is accessible here : [Multi-Frequential Harmonic Balance Approach for the Simulation of Contra-Rotating Open Rotors : Application to Aeroelasticity](http://www.theses.fr/2014ENAM0010)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have a good LaTeX distribution installed to be able to compile this document.

### Compiling

To compile the document, simply launch latexmk with the pdf argument :

```
latexmk -pdf adrien_gomar_phd.tex
```

and boom, you've got yourself a nice example of my PhD thesis. Enjoy reading it if you fancy :)
