# Flow around contra-rotating open rotors: general information
    * Background
    * Aerodynamic of an isolated propeller
    * Aerodynamic of contra-rotating open rotor
    * A few words on aeroelasticity
        * experimental aeroelasticity
        * numerical aeroelasticity

# 
    * equation that I solve
    * elsA
    * ALE / aeroelasticity presentation

# Harmonic balance methods
    * state of the art
    * mono-frequential (advantages)
    * multi-frequential (advantages and questions that it raises)
    * toy problems (advantages)
        - capturing a sinusoidal flow
        - capturing a wake / clocking effects
    * toy problems (drawbacks)
        - non evenly spaced timelevels
        - signal to capture (wake / sinus / step function)

# Improving the method
    * algorithm to automatically choose the timelevels
    * convergence of spectral methods : analyzing the spectrum of the wake
    * partial conclusion: we may go to industrial applications

# application to the aeroelasticity of contra-rotating open rotors
    * validation of the proposed approach (STCF 11)
    * aeroelasticity of an isolated contra-rotating open rotor
    * aeroelasticity of an installed contra-rotating open rotor
